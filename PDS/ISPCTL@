)F  ISPCTL - List open ISPF command tables

The  ISPCTL dialog  lists the  open command  tables. You  can then
select view or edit of a single table.
 Note that a  table may me listed even though  it is not viewable,
this  can happen  if the  table has  been opened  from a  LIBDEF'd
library in another screen.
